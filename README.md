- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnww328, a recently retired high school physics and chemistry teacher (2022)
- 👀 I’m interested in swift coding so I can make educational IOS apps
- 🌱 I’m currently learning swift on Udemy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making a chemistry Iphone quiz program and I need to handle arrays of questions and answers choices of chemical formulas and dynamically make the numbers subscripts rather than storing them as RTF files.
